## Introduction

This project aims to predict house prices using a machine learning regression model. It involves preprocessing the dataset, training a model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions on new data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/infi123/Python-ML-Model.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Data Preprocessing: Run the `data_preprocessing.py` script to preprocess the dataset.

2. Model Training: Run the `model_training.py` script to train the regression model.

3. Model Evaluation: Run the `model_evaluation.py` script to evaluate the trained model's performance.

4. Prediction: Run the `predict.py` script to make predictions on new unseen data.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. Lower RMSE values indicate better model accuracy.

## Prediction

To make predictions on new data, provide the input features in the `unseen_data.csv` file and run the `predict.py` script.
